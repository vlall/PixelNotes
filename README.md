PixelNotes
==========

###Background
PixelNotes reads a given input of an image in 'jpg' format and outputs a textfile of the altered compositional matrix.
This matrix can then be interpreted as input notes for a Max MSP composition.


###Future Updates
PixelNotes will be made compatible to interpret an image in various ways.
Each interpretation will be given its own class in Java. 
From this, we will be able to create classes that compose in particular states of emotion.
For example:

1. A class for Happy, Sad, Scared, Relaxed, Motivated ect.. The more objects, the more interpretations.
2. Relating the color wheel to the Circle of Fifths
3. **We also need to find a way to understand the whole image rather than its individual colors.**
